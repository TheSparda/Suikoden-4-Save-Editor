// Long-description collapse ("Show more") shared by both editors and the Node tests.
//
// Ported from the Suikoden III editor (issue #6), which is where the reasoning below was
// earned. Game-agnostic: no ids, offsets or table names from either game appear here.
//
// This repo's tabs explain themselves at length: what was disassembled, what has been played,
// what is still untested. That prose is the reason a lot of these switches are usable at all,
// so none of it is deleted — but a wall of text above a table pushes the table itself off a
// phone screen, and someone who already knows what the tab does has to scroll
// past the same essay every visit.
//
// So each long block gets a one-line summary and a button. Authors opt a block in by putting
// the summary in `data-sum` on the block itself:
//
//     <div class="muted" data-sum="Brief version, one line.">…the full description…</div>
//
// An empty `data-sum=""` means "derive it from the first sentence(s)", which is right where a
// block already opens with its own summary.
//
// Three properties this has to keep:
//
//   * The full text stays IN THE DOM, hidden. It is never rebuilt from a string, and the
//     collapsed half is `hidden` rather than removed, so `textContent` still sees all of it
//     (several e2e checks read `textContent` of a whole tab) and Ctrl-F still finds it.
//   * Expanded state is keyed by the summary, not by the element. Both editors re-render whole
//     tabs into `innerHTML` on every filter keystroke and every staged edit, which would
//     otherwise snap an opened description shut mid-read — the same failure the `<details>`
//     cards hit when they tracked open state only in the DOM.
//   * Children are MOVED, not re-serialised. A block can hold live nodes (a picker button, a
//     staged-edit marker), and `innerHTML` round-tripping them would drop their handlers.
//
// The length gate is applied at runtime, not by the author: a lot of these descriptions are
// built with `${cond ? "…" : ""}` and shrink on a disc where the feature is unavailable. A
// block that renders short is left alone rather than collapsed behind a button that reveals
// one extra clause.
(function (root) {
  // Two ways a block earns a button, because the two failure modes are different: a
  // many-sentenced block is a wall of argument even when it is short, and a long one is a wall
  // of pixels even when it is a single sentence. Either is enough.
  //
  // The sentence rule is the shape the request named. The character count catches what it
  // misses: two sentences of 150 characters each are a wall too, and on a phone that is six
  // lines above the table you came for.
