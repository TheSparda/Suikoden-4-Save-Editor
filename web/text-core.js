// Pure in-ELF string scanner shared by the ISO editor (iso.js) and the Node tests.
// No DOM / no ISO — it takes a byte block and returns the editable string slots in it.
//
// The boot ELF stores its English UI text as printable-ASCII runs. There is no table of
// contents for them, so the desktop editor finds them by scanning for printable runs and
// filtering out the ones that look like code/format strings rather than prose. This is a
// originally a port of `_looks_like_text` / `read_texts` in the retired Editor/s3editor.py; the
// agree, or the same disc would offer different strings in each editor, so the heuristic
// lives here in one testable place and validate.mjs asserts the rules still match.
//
// Only bytes 32..126 are accumulated, so every character reaching the filter is ASCII —
// which is why Python's isalpha()/islower() reduce to /[A-Za-z]/ and /[a-z]/ here.
//
// NOTE ON SCOPE FOR SUIKODEN IV — measured, not assumed. Scanning the real 3.2 MB boot ELF
// returns 239 runs, and the great majority are developer strings ("sceMcInit: error",
// "null pointer(in gMapSeaBindHeightTable)"). But a real, narrow class of user-facing prose IS
// there: the memory-card and save/load messages the engine itself shows —
//
//     "Please select MEMORY CARD slot."   "Load successful. "   "Save successful. "
//     "Return to the Title Screen"        "Do you wish to begin anyway?"
//     "Congratulations! You have cleared" / "the game! You can now save"
//
// What is NOT here: item names, character names, rune names, and story dialogue. Those live
// packed inside FILEDATA (#31), which is why s4_item_names.json had to be extracted from a cheat
// table. Non-ASCII was checked too before concluding: UTF-16LE and Shift-JIS full-width scans
// return only byte-table false positives, so ASCII is the encoding.
