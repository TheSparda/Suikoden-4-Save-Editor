"""PINE client — talk to a running PCSX2 over its instrumentation socket.

PINE ("Protocol for Instrumentation of Network Emulators") is PCSX2's built-in IPC
server: enable it under Settings -> Advanced -> Enable PINE Server (default slot
28011). It is the only supported way to read and write the emulated PS2's memory from
another process while the game runs, which is what makes any of this automatable —
without it the alternatives are screen-scraping or hand-driving the GUI debugger.

Wire format (one request may carry several commands back to back):

    request : u32 total_len (counts itself) | u8 opcode | args... | [next command...]
    reply   : u32 total_len (counts itself) | u8 result (0 = OK, 0xFF = FAIL) | data...

Reply payloads appear in command order with no per-command framing, so a batch is only
decodable because every opcode has a fixed-width result. That is also why `Client`
verifies batching with a two-read handshake on connect and falls back to one command
per message if the reply doesn't come back the expected length: the batch shape is the
part of this protocol we could not verify against a running emulator here, and a wrong
guess would silently mis-attribute values to addresses.

Transport is a unix socket on Linux/macOS ($XDG_RUNTIME_DIR or /tmp, named `pcsx2.sock`
for the default slot and `pcsx2.sock.<slot>` otherwise) and a loopback TCP port on
Windows.
